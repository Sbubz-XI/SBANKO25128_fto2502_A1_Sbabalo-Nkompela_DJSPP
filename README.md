# Project Brief: React Podcast App

Hey there! I built a React-based podcast app where you can browse, play, and favourite episodes. The app also has a carousel for recommended episodes, a theme toggle, and an audio player so you can listen directly in the app.

## What I Built

### Recommended Carousel
I added a carousel to show recommended podcast episodes. It scrolls smoothly and works on all screen sizes. You can click arrows or swipe on mobile to check out different episodes.

### Favourites Page
I made a Favourites page where you can see all the episodes you’ve marked as your favourites. Each episode is added individually so you don’t get duplicates. You can also remove any episode you don’t want anymore, and everything is saved in `localStorage`.

### Theme Toggle
I added a simple light/dark mode toggle. Clicking it switches the theme across the entire app, and it remembers your choice even if you refresh or come back later.

### Audio Player
The audio player lets you play podcast episodes right in the app. You can play, pause, and seek through episodes. Each episode keeps its playback state so your experience is smooth.

## How It Went
Honestly, this project was really tough. I struggled a lot with:

- Making sure each episode could be favourited individually without messing up the rest.
- Keeping the theme consistent everywhere.
- Managing the audio player state across different components.

But I kept researching, asked peers for help, and used resources on the Student LMS. In the end, everything worked… maybe not perfectly, but partially successful!  

## Conclusion
Overall, I got all the main features working: carousel, favourites page, theme toggle, and audio player. I learned a ton about React, state management, and handling persistent data. It was a challenge, but totally worth it!
